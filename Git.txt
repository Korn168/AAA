After reviewing the activities proposed by the Data PM team, I would like to share some important points:
Regarding TSS, while a BRD is not required, please ensure that you prepare detailed technical data requirements.
As Dr. Somsakul is the owner of Health data, we will need to obtain their endorsement during the confirmation and testing phases.
Test case scenarios should be prepared by business users - you may begin this preparation ahead of the UAT scheduled for March 24th.
Since implementation will be completed in a single phase, please consider any potential additional requirements and raise them in advance.
